# CFTRvariants
Shell script to call, annotate and filter CFTR variants.  

**`CFscreen.sh`** script is an illustration of the main steps during identification of the
genetic variants relevant to Cystic Fibrosis.  

**Steps implemented in `CFscreen.sh`:**  
Goal: use genomic data from a patient to identify CF-relevant mutations.  

Main steps:  

1. Identify mutations in CFTR gene present in HG00121 individual from 1000 Genomes project   
Sample info: http://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/sample/HG00121  
Sequence Data: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data/HG00121/  

2. Check if any identified mutations are CF-causing based on the list provided by
CFTR2 website (https://www.cftr2.org/mutations_history)     

3. Compare results with the results recorded in VCF file generated by 1000 Genomes project
